But unlike Ethereum, DucatusX uses a “Proof of Authority” consensus algorithm which significantly reduces its maintenance cost. In the future, it is envisioned to switch to “Proof of Stake”, giving users even more confidence in choosing DucatusX for their projects. On DucatusX, the blocks are produced regularly by 3 proven and secured nodes, resulting in stable cost and reliable speed of block production."
